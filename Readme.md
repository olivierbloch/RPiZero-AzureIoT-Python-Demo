# Simple Azure IoT demo with Raspberry Pi Zero W

This repo contains a couple very simple Python scripts showing how to connect a Raspberry Pi Zero W to Azure IoT Hub using the Python SDK.
I have been using a [Pimoroni](https://learn.pimoroni.com/) Rpi Zero W kit with a [Blinkt](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-blinkt) led strip. 

Detailed instructions coming soon
